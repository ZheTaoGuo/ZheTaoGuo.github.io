                BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the
                Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that was formed in
                2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The
                septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and
                Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally
                a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range
                of genres.

        BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang
        Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping. The
        lineup was finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook
        in 2012 when Jin, the oldest member of the group, was twenty-years-old.
        Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their
        presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on
        YouTube and SoundCloud.

    </div>
    <p class="card-text">
      In November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the
      American Music Awards, raising their profile internationally. That same
      month, Guinness World Records revealed that BTS had earned a spot in
      their 2018 edition for "having the world's most Twitter engagements for
      a music group". In December, they also became the first K-pop group to
      perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to welcome the new year
      and made their Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi's Japan Music
      Station Super Live.

        <h3>Cultural Impact</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="card-text">
      Billboard's Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS are
      comparable to and as influential as the Beatles and the Monkees. Nielsen
      Music Vice President Helena Kosinski said that "although BTS weren't the
      first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to
      become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but also to
      the 50s and 60s age demographic." As the first non-English speaking
      artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and
      third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling
      artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming
      platforms, coming second only to Drake.
